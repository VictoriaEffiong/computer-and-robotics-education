                                    Processing are tackling a crucial challenge in our hyper-expanding digital age:
                                    safeguarding question-answering systems that extract information from websites.
                                    These
                                    systems are vulnerable to manipulation by malicious actors who inject false

                                    threatening their reliability.</span></p>
                            <p><span>The researchers’ new Confidence from Answer Redundancy
                                    method works by searching for and comparing multiple sources that address the same
                                    question, determining which response is most likely to be correct even when some of
                                    the
                                    information has been falsified or otherwise altered.</span></p>
                            <p><span>“Our approach significantly reduced the dissemination of false information in user
                                    outputs, doubling accuracy in certain scenarios, and proved effective across all
                                    levels of malicious content, from 1% to 100% of poisoned articles,” says PhD student
                                    <a href="https://orionweller.github.io/">Orion Weller</a>
                                    , one of the researchers on the team. “Our method distinguishes
                                    high-confidence responses from uncertain ones, prompting the system to consider
                                    alternative queries when confidence is low, thus bolstering resilience against
                                    adversarial attacks.”</span></p>
                            <p><span>The team’s results were published and presented at the <a
                                        href="https://2024.eacl.org/">18th Conference

                                    spring.
                                    Weller and his team used advanced computational models to generate a broad spectrum
                                    of questions that were closely related, seeking answers from diverse sources. This
                                    reduced reliance on any single source that included potentially compromised
                                    data.</span></p>
                            <p><span>To test how well their method worked, the researchers used benchmarks like Natural
                                    Questions—a large Google dataset comprising real queries that people have asked the
                                    search engine—and TriviaQA—another large-scale dataset designed to train AI models
                                    to answer trivia questions—on simulated scenarios where Wikipedia pages answers had
                                    been maliciously altered. Their approach proved effective, identifying correct
                                    answers 20% more often.</span></p>
                            <p><span>“This was evident when <a href="#">Google’s new AI-generated answers</a> replaced
                                    traditional
                                    ranked search results, but these responses were often wrong. Experts warned that
                                    this feature could spread misinformation and bias, endangering users in critical
                                    situations. Google has made some fixes to handle these issues, but concerns remain
                                    about the impact on information accuracy and the disruption of traffic to
                                    traditional websites,” Weller says.</span></p>

                            <h3>Forget-me-not: Selective memory can help AI remember more, not
                                less</h3>

                            <p class="first-para"><span>
                                    Massive amounts of medical data—from imaging scans, patient visits, and electronic
                                    health records—provides an unprecedented opportunity for training health care AI
                                    models. But these data present their own challenges: Training AI models on
                                    continually arriving data is impractical at best and catastrophic at worst, as AI
                                    tends to forget old data when it learns new data.</span></p>
                            <p><span>A team from the Johns Hopkins University’s Computational Cognition, Vision, and
                                    Learning research group has developed a potential solution: an efficient online
                                    learning method that significantly reduces AI models’ tendency to forget older data
                                    by ensuring the models learn from only the most significant data samples. The team
                                    will present its work at the 27th International Conference on Medical Image
                                    Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention, to be held October 6–10 in Marrakesh,
                                    Morocco.</span></p>
                            <p><span>The researchers’ method first uses text encoding to understand and categorize the
                                    medical data that an AI model is being trained on.</span></p>
                            <p><span>“This means that the AI can recognize and work with classes of pathologies or
                                    organs just by their descriptions,” explains Yu-Cheng Chou, a PhD student in the
                                    Department of Computer Science and one of the members on the team.</span></p>

                            <p><span>The group’s method then utilizes three different types of memory to ensure maximum
                                    learning efficiency. First, it uses linear memory to store recent samples as new
                                    data become available, enabling continuous training without having to revisit old
                                    data or make inefficient passes through the whole dataset.</span></p>
                            <p><span>It then uses dynamic memory to choose data samples based on uniqueness, enhancing
                                    the diversity of the training data. Preserving samples from different time periods
                                    and sources prevents the model from forgetting older data, solving one of the key
                                    challenges in training on massive datasets, says Chou.</span></p>

                            <h3>Computer Scientist Identifies JavaScript Vulnerability in Thousands of Websites
                            </h3>

                            <p class="first-para"><span>Millions of developers use JavaScript to build websites and
                                    mobile apps, making it one of the most popular programming languages in the world.
                                    But according to Johns Hopkins researchers, thousands of JavaScript websites are
                                    vulnerable to a security flaw that could result in manipulating the site’s URL or
                                    stealing a user’s profile information.</span></p>
                            <p><span>Known as prototype pollution, the flaw allows attackers to modify, or “pollute,” a
                                    prototype, which is a built-in property of a JavaScript object. An attacker who
                                    manages to alter a JavaScript object prototype can execute a variety of malicious
                                    actions.</span></p>
                            <p><span>With a framework they call ProbeTheProto, researchers from the Johns Hopkins
                                    Information Security Institute analyzed one million websites running on JavaScript
                                    and found that more than 2,700 websites—some of them the most visited in the
                                    world—had multiple flaws that could expose them to prototype pollution.</span></p>
                            <p><span>Ten of the sites were among the top 1,000 most visited websites of the year,
                                    including Weebly.com, CNET.com, and McKinsey.com.</span></p>
                            <p><span>In Javascript, an object is a collection of related data or functionality; for
                                    example, a user account object may contain such data as usernames, passwords, and
                                    e-mail addresses. Once an attacker makes a change to an object prototype, it will
                                    affect how the object works throughout the entire application and opens the door for
                                    more serious vulnerabilities, Cao adds.</span></p>
                            <p><span>He and his team set out to the study this snowball effect using dynamic taint
                                    analysis, a method in which inputs to the application are labeled with a special
                                    “tainted” marker and the researchers observe how the tainted data propagates through
                                    the program. If the marker is still there at the program’s output, the researchers
                                    know that the application is vulnerable to exploitable input attacks that could lead
                                    to some unplanned action</span></p>
                            <p><span>The researchers identified three major input attacks that can be caused by
                                    prototype pollution: cross-site scripting (XSS), cookie manipulation, and URL
                                    manipulation. Such vulnerabilities on public websites provide ample opportunities
                                    for cyber criminals to hijack passwords and install malware, among other nefarious
                                    activities</span></p>

                            <p class="first-para"><span>In December, students in the Johns Hopkins University
                                    Information Security Institute’s Master of Science in Security Informatics program
                                    presented their capstone projects. These projects address real-world problems,
                                    include technology and non-technology components, and are informed by guidance from
                                    faculty and industry mentors.</span></p>
                            <p><span>MSSI student Anais Huang led a capstone project called TorEye, in which she
                                    proposed a mechanism to detect malicious Tor traffic. Tor is a type of network that
                                    anonymizes web traffic by hiding internet protocol (IP) addresses and browsing
                                    activity. Huang utilized a scaled-down Tor network to perform simulations and
                                    experimental attacks to generate traffic for the development of datasets to be used
                                    in the future. Tor attacks aim to harm privacy and anonymity, she says.</span></p>
                            <p><span>“As a security researcher, I think it is important to know whether a relay is up,
                                    but it’s also important to know whether it is malicious,” Huang explains. “I
                                    consider detecting malicious relays to be the duty of security researchers like me.
                                    A practical detection mechanism is needed so that we don’t transfer this
                                    responsibility to Tor users. Personally, I think that TorEye can help to accelerate
                                    Tor’s flag voting process.”</span></p>
                            <p><span>MSSI students Aditya Gaur and Preetham Nagesh presented another capstone project
                                    called rSentinel, a ransomware detection and diagnosis tool designed for
                                    environments with multiple nodes that are performing various tasks in a distributed
                                    network. The students say they developed the tool “to mitigate the impact of
                                    ransomware outbreaks by preventing their propagation across distributed
                                    networks.”</span></p>
                            <p><span>Gaur and Nagesh explain that they had the inspiration to develop rSentinel after a

                            <h3>How I came to study Computer Education</h3>

                            <!-- <p class="first-para"><span>"At first, i wanted to become a Doctor But was not sure of the
                                    field to major in. Even though I was scared of the sight of blood, syringes, smell
                                    of drugs and many more. When I got to Senior Secondary in High school, My love for
                                    computer came. I would sit and wonder how thing are made, how are electronics made,
                                    and many more questions. This is what brought me to computer science".</span></p> -->
                            <p><span>To learn about Victoria, check out this brief Q&A.</span></p>
                            <h4><span>When did you first discover the STEM field?</span></h4>
                            <p><span class="first-para">My dad used to like this particular TV show when I was little.
                                    That was my
                                    first time of seeing a robot. A botten would be pressed and the robot would perform
                                    a task. I asked my dad how the made the iron do that and he responded that it
                                    responded to a command already programmed into its body. That piqued my interest in
                                    STEM because I also wanted to do that.</span></p>

                            <h4><span>Why did you choose to come to Computer Education?</span></h4>
                            <p><span>To be frank, I never knew there was a course as this and I never wanted to do
                                    anything with teaching. I could get admitted in computer engineering, had to change
                                    course and so far, it's been worthwhile. I enjoy teaching while I also solve
                                    technical problems in computer. Perfect pair I would say.</span></p>

                            <h4><span>What advice do you have for women pursuing a STEM career?</span></h4>
                            <p><span>Be mindful of the microaggressions that may occur in male dominated fields. The
                                    people marginalizing you will often give rationalizations for it. During
                                    classes my male counterparts often said things to me like, ‘I worked in industry so
                                    I have more coding experience than you’ and then would ask me to do the project
                                    write-up, rather than the coding. I don’t think my peers were being intentionally
                                    sexist, I just I think it’s ingrained in the culture and in the society. Sometimes,
                                    speaking up in the moment can help. I also think it’s important to have a colleague
                                    or friend in a similar field, who can relate to your experience and offer
                                    support.</span></p>

                            <!-- <h4><span>So far how has it been here?</span></h4>
                            <p><span>It hasn't been easy-peasy or simple, but I have been able to stay afloat among my
                                    counterparts. I am loving the whole experience.</span></p> -->

                            <h3>In AI we trust?</h3>

                            <p class="first-para"><span>The rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have
                                    sparked significant debate about the level of trust we should place in these
                                    systems. On one hand, AI has proven to be a powerful tool, enhancing efficiency,
                                    accuracy, and innovation across various industries. From healthcare diagnostics to
                                    financial forecasting, AI's ability to process vast amounts of data and identify
                                    patterns that elude human perception has led to outcomes that were previously
                                    unimaginable. This potential makes AI an indispensable asset in our modern
                                    world.</span></p>

                            <p><span>However, the question of trust is complex. While AI can execute tasks with
                                    remarkable precision, it lacks the human qualities of empathy, ethics, and judgment.
                                    AI systems are only as reliable as the data they are trained on, and biases in these
                                    datasets can lead to skewed or unfair outcomes. Moreover, the opacity of many AI
                                    algorithms—often described as "black boxes"—can make it difficult to understand how
                                    decisions are made, raising concerns about accountability and transparency.</span>
                            </p>
                            <p><span>Trust in AI also hinges on the intentions of those who deploy it. When used
                                    responsibly, AI can contribute to the greater good, but when misused, it can lead to
                                    significant harm, such as privacy violations, job displacement, and the
                                    reinforcement of societal inequalities. The key to fostering trust in AI lies in a
                                    balanced approach—one that combines technological innovation with robust ethical
                                    standards, transparency, and human oversight.</span></p>
                            <p><span>In conclusion, while AI holds immense potential to transform our world positively,
                                    trust in AI should not be blind. It must be earned through careful design, ethical
                                    considerations, and continuous scrutiny to ensure that AI serves humanity in a fair
                                    and just manner.</span></p>
